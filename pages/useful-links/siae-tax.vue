            SIAE (Societ√† Italiana degli Autori ed Editori) is the Italian Society of Authors and Publishers. It is the
            main copyright collecting agency in Italy, responsible for protecting intellectual property rights and
            collecting royalties for the use of copyrighted material, including music, during public events such as
            weddings.

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            SIAE Tax is a mandatory fee that must be paid when copyrighted music is played at public or private events
            in Italy, including weddings. This tax ensures that artists, composers, and copyright holders receive fair
            compensation for the use of their work during your special day.

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">Why is SIAE Tax Mandatory in Italy?</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            In Italy, the SIAE Tax is mandatory by law (Law on Copyright n. 633/1941) to protect intellectual property
            rights. Unlike some other countries, Italy has centralized this process through SIAE, making it the official
            body responsible for collecting and distributing royalties to artists and copyright holders.
